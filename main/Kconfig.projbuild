            Enable this option to allow the use of an external antenna switch (need to configure GPIO).
            The UI will then allow you to choose between antennas. At the moment only two antennas are supported.
            Beware that for some boards the antenna switch sometimes must be activated first by setting a GPIO.
            Do that in code. Enabling of the switch is done automatically for the official HW 1.x based on the ESP32C6.

            This GPIOs high/low state is used to indicate to the RF switch what antenna to choose.

            USB/JTAG on the official HWv1.x boards for DroneBridge for ESP32 is connected to the USB-C port. 
            By using this port a ground station can connect to the ESP32 without the use of an UART-to-USB adapter.
            Intended for use on ground station ESP32 units directly connected to a GCS computer via USB.
            Requires ESP_CONSOLE_SECONDARY_NONE set to yes.

                This interface is attached to the USB port of the official DroneBridge for ESP32 PCB in HW v1.x versions.
                A ground control station can connect to the USB port directly without having to use a FTDI in between.
                Not intended for connecting to a UAV etc. Use native UART instead.
