            Select website deploy mode.
            You can deploy website to host, and ESP32 will retrieve them in a semihost way (JTAG is needed).
            You can deploy website to SD card or SPI flash, and ESP32 will retrieve them via SDIO/SPI interface.
            Detailed operation steps are listed in the example README file.

            help
                Deploy website to host.
                It is recommended to choose this mode during developing.
        config WEB_DEPLOY_SF
            bool "Deploy website to SPI Nor Flash"
            help
                Deploy website to SPI Nor Flash.
                Choose this in production mode or if the size of website is small (less than 2MB).

                When using semihost in ESP32, you should specify the host path which will be mounted to VFS.
                Note that only absolute path is acceptable.
